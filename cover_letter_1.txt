To the respected referee:

We submit this short paper that confirms our recent prediction of effects of wide-field radio interferometric measurements and their implications for foreground contamination of the cosmological HI signal from the epoch of reionization. This is a subject of very active study within the MWA collaboration and outside. Since these results will inform the design and analysis choices of future instruments such as HERA and SKA, it is essential to quickly confirm these important predictions from modeling so the results can be applied to such future designs.
